## Hello DevOps Team;

- We have coded a web-site application with PostgreSQL database, Node.js and React.js. 

- User infos are kept on PostgreSQL database on backend. You should create a PostgreSQL container and a password for default user postgres. You don't need to create a different user for PostgreSQL. 

- To handshake Node.js container and PostgreSQL database container, before creating Node.js image, you have to fill the necessary places `.env` file under server folder. This file is very important to connect database and Node.js backend server. 

- To handshake React.js server and Node.js server, before creating React.js image, you have to fill the necessary places `.env` file under client folder. This file also is very important to connect Node.js backend server and React.js frontend server. 


Thanks Dear DevOps,

Good Luck.
